## Description
The Fitness App uses Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose. Upon opening the App, the user will see a page with the data of the last workout including the workout date, total duration, number of exercises performed, and total distance, weight, sets, and reps. The user can then create a new workout, or continue with the last workout. They can then add cardio or resistance exercises to the last workout or a new workout. The dashboard displays statistics about the workouts.
